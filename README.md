**Title:** Predicting Gold Recovery Application with LightningChart Python

**Introduction**

This project presents a comprehensive data visualization and predictive analytics solution designed to optimize gold recovery processes in an industrial setting. Utilizing historical data, the project integrates sophisticated machine learning methods with interactive visualization capabilities to provide real-time insights and enhance operational decision-making. The primary goal is to predict gold recovery and optimize profit by visualizing key factors and their dynamic changes.

**LightningChart Python**

LightningChart Python has been integral to this project, providing high-performance, real-time data visualization. Its advanced capabilities, including dynamic heatmaps, interactive bubble charts, real-time line and area charts, and 3D visualizations, effectively communicate complex relationships within gold recovery data. LightningChart's capacity for handling large datasets smoothly enables rapid and insightful data interpretation crucial for real-time predictive analysis in industrial applications.

**Reviewing Libraries**

Key libraries used include:

- **Pandas:** Essential for data manipulation and preprocessing tasks, such as handling missing values, outlier removal, and organizing data for analysis.
- **NumPy:** Utilized for numerical computations, particularly in statistical analysis and feature scaling.
- **scipy & scikit-learn:** Leveraged for advanced machine learning techniques including KDE (Kernel Density Estimation), Random Forest regression modeling, and SMOGN for synthetic minority oversampling.
- **trimesh:** Employed for processing and visualizing 3D mesh models, representing the concentration and tail of materials graphically.

These libraries collectively facilitated comprehensive data cleaning, modeling, and real-time analytical processes, underpinning the predictive power and clarity of visualizations presented in the dashboards.
